## Features

- **Simulation**: Simulate various page replacement algorithms and analyze their performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the cache content at each time slice for better understanding.
- **Analysis**: Analyze page fault occurrence over time to evaluate algorithm efficiency.
- **Customization**: Configure parameters such as the number of frames and the page reference string to tailor the simulation.
